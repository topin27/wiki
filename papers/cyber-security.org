*** INTRODUCTION

使用了NetFlow进行获取数据集，为了效率，只采样了一部分数据 (e.g., one
packet out of 10,000 is considered)。

*** A STUDY OF TRAFFIC PATTERNS IN AN ORGANIZATIONAL PRIVATE NETWORK

Define the service as a tuple (IP address, port number, transport
protocol ID), while the client of a service is defined as an IP address
which is employed for communicating with the service.

When we investigated services with few clients more closely, we
discovered that a large part of them are specialized services which are
not used by humans. For example, we found that about 20% of all services
are SNMP agents which are accessed by few dedicated network management
nodes. In addition to SNMP, a number of other protocols are extensively
employed in the private network for system management, for
communications between infrastructure components, etc.

Another interesting phenomenon is that clients often access services
which other clients have recently used, and seldom establish a
connection to a rarely used service.

*** Introduction

介绍了入侵检测系统的种类:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are used to detect attacks against
  hosts or networks. There are two types of IDSs: Host-based Intrusion
  Detection System (HIDS) and Network-based Intrusion Detection System.
  HIDS protects a certain host or system, while NIDS protects a network
  of hosts and systems.
#+END_QUOTE

研究领域常用的攻击分类：

-  DOS attack
-  User to root
-  Remote to User
-  Probes: In this type of attacks, the attacker tries to collect any
   possible relevant information in the network. In this class, two
   famous types of attacks exist: Host Sweep and Port Scan Attacks. Host
   Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while
   port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the
   network.

*** Network Probes

Any network attack consists of three stages that usually occur in
sequence: *network probe*, *attacks activity*, and *footprint
clearance*.

Network probe的两种类型：

1. Host Sweep Attacks：常用的手段有TCP ECHO, UDP ECHO, ICMP Sweep
2. Port Scan Attacks：有以下不同的行为

   -  One host-different ports
   -  Different host-one ports
   -  Different host-different ports

*** Network intrusion detection system using attack behavior
classification

使用了TDNN（Time Delay Neural Network）来进行建模。

对于Host Sweep Attack，提取了以下特征：

1. 源ip
2. 目的ip
3. 目的端口
4. 协议类型

对于Port Scan Attack，提取了以下特征：

1. 源ip
2. 目的ip
3. 目的端口
4. SYN标志
5. ACK标志
6. FIN标志
7. 协议类型

做了两个假设：

1. 在一连串的包序列流中，至少需要3个包才能检测出攻击（m=3）；
2. 如果连续10个包中有3个包都检测出有攻击的迹象，那么可以认为发生了攻击（n=10）。

Networks[J]. Proc.usenix System Administration Conf, 1999:229--238.
paper

一篇介绍snort工具的论文，论文的作者也是Snort的作者。

*** Snort定义

*Snort* is a libpcap-based [PCAP94] packet sniffer and logger that can
be used as a lightweight network intrusion detection system (NIDS). It
features rules based logging to perform content pattern matching and
detect a variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows
[ALE96], stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, and much more.
Snort has real-time alerting capability, with alerts being sent to
syslog, Server Message Block (SMB) ``WinPopup'' messages, or a separate
``alert'' file. Snort is configured using command line switches and
optional Berkeley Packet Filter [BPF93] commands.

*** Snort和tcpdump的区别

Snort is cosmetically similar to tcpdump [TCPD91] but is more focused on
the security applica-tions of packet sniffing. The major feature that
Snort has which tcpdump does not is packet payload inspec-tion. Snort
decodes the application layer of a packet and can be given rules to
collect traffic that has spe-cific data contained within its application
layer. This allows Snort to detect many types of hostile activity,
including buffer overflows, CGI scans, or any other data in the packet
payload that can be characterized in a unique detection fingerprint.

简单说来，snort区别于tcpdump是因为其不仅可以抓取包，而且可以根据规则对包分析并响应。

Anomaly Detection. HVD Heide，N Barendregt]] paper

介绍了常见的集中DNS攻击时DNS包的特点。

*** Methods

两种方法，一种实时的，一种基于统计、离线的。

1. DNS Anomaly Detection

   We focus on the data send to or from TCP or UDP port 53. The very
   first analysis method is to detect if we can find DNS data in the
   packet. Any packet without DNS data is suspicious since we found no
   good reason for non-DNS packets to use port 53.

   Most LANs use internal mail servers or a mail server hosted by their
   ISP to send e-mails. These mail servers will deliver the e-mails on
   behalf of the client to the destination domain. A client PC has
   therefore no reason to query MX records for domains. An MX query
   could therefore indicate the client is infected with a mass-mailer
   worm. This method will also trigger an immediate alert and further
   checks will be skipped.

   Once we identified a proper DNS query or response the data strings
   will be checked against a pre-configured list of keywords. This
   method is very similar to a domain blacklist but is not limited to a
   list of known malici ous domains. This method will probably identify
   mostly human trigger anomalo us DNS traffic, e.g. an network
   administrator could filter all requests with the w ord ”casino” in
   the domain.

2. Blacklist

3. Tunnel DNS Detection

   Since DNS data is often poorly monitored and often allowed to pass
   through the firewall, it is an ideal candidate for a covert channel.

   The detection of a covert channel in DNS is based on two analys is
   methods. The first method analyzes the packet characteristics and the
   second method analyzes the data.

   There are a few characteristics of the DNS packet that could
   distinguish a packet used in a covert channel. If the channel is used
   to transport reasonable amounts of data, the length of the LLD
   (Lowest Level Domain) in the query or the size o f the response
   record can easily be checked. The average length of the one million
   most used domains is ten characters, where the average query length
   of a DNS tunnel used to copy a random file is well over 30
   characters. If this method is used in combination with timing
   analysis, a high volume stream with large DNS packets can be
   identified.

   Anomalies in the record types of the response packets can also easily
   be identified. The NULL record is an experimental record and should
   not be used in production environments and as described in section
   4.1, most client systems have no reason to query an MX record.

4. Character Frequency

   Domain names are strings mostly chosen by humans and should be
   recognizable by humans. Therefore the domain names consist of one or
   more words and therefore closely follow the natural language
   characteristics. If the language of the users can be predicted, the
   characteristics of the language can be compared with the domain names
   the users system requests and an assumption can be made if the domain
   name is generated by the system or chosen by the user.

   The data hidden in DNS is often normal text and therefore follows the
   natural language characteristics. It is however very likely the
   adversary would compress and encrypt the data to optimize the
   bandwidth and hide the smuggled data. The encryption will by
   definition obfuscate the natural language characteristics and this
   could be exploited by our detection method.

   A different implementation could be the detection of anomalous domain
   names. Botnets C&C servers often change domain names and therefore
   use random strings. This could be detected but will be a challenge.
   The data of a single domain is very limited and would probably not
   contain all possible characters. If this data is stored and we can
   analyze a number of domains, the detection could be a lot more
   certain. The obvious trade off is the time it takes before the
   anomaly is detected.

   1. Top Domain N-gram analysis

      Kenton Born and David Gustafson compared the letter frequency
      table for the English language with a list of one million most
      frequent used domains.

      英文语境下的字母频率和DNS语境下的字母频率是不同的（不管是unigram还是bigram还是trigram）。

   2. Zipflan Distribution

      a more generic detection method could be created with letter
      frequencies. The frequency tables are not similar for different
      languages but the distribution of the frequencies over the
      different ranks in the table are very similar.

      Zipf's Law states that the frequency of a word is inversely
      proportional to its place in the frequency table. So the most
      frequent word will occur twice as often as the second most
      frequent word.

      This means that the letter itself is not relevant for the
      detection method but the frequency distribution of the letters is.

      If a similar graph would be made of an encrypted data channel the
      frequency distribution would by definition be almost even and the
      line would be a flat horizontal line. This can off-course easily
      be detected and works for any western language.

5. Fast-Flux Detection

   *Fast-flux* is a technique used by cyber-criminals to hide critical
   hosts behind an ever changing set of compromised hosts. A modified
   DNS server is used that will return a different set of IP addresses
   for a given domain over time. These addresses belong to compromised
   hosts that will relay for instance HTTP (web) traffic to a server
   hosting a malicious site. This server is sometimes called the
   fast-flux mothership.

   There are three things that should be noticed. The first obvious
   notion is the number of records. The domain resolves to ten A records
   which is a lot for most websites. The second notion would be the IP
   addresses the domain resolves to. The addresses are spread over a
   large number of address spaces. Then the Time To Live (TTL) of the
   records is abnormally low. It has been set to 300 seconds, or five
   minutes. This will store the results only for a short period of time
   in the cache of the client or its caching name server. This allows
   the fast-flux service provider to switch hosts very frequently, to
   mitigate the fact that bots are normal client PCs which are not
   reliable as service providers.

   There is a second fast-flux technique which is increasing in
   popularity, called double flux. A double flux service provider will
   host the domains name servers also on the botnet, mitigating the
   weakest link of a single flux domain. A single flux domain can be
   shut down by shutting down its name servers. A double flux service
   provider will regulary update the records at the domain registrar to
   reflect the changes in its botnet.

6. Time Based Analysis

   One of the more abstract methods is the time based analysis method.
   This method is designed to detect anomalies in the timing of queries.
   By collecting the queried domains, the time they occured and the host
   that initiated the query a number of anomalies can be detected. The
   most interesting anomalies we examined could all indicate botnet
   activety.

   Most botnet programs are designed to periodically query a central
   server for commands to execute. The server could instruct its bots to
   start scanning for vulnerable systems, start sending spam e-mails or
   download a malicious program. Botnet herders will program the domain
   name of the server in the botnet client software, so the bots will be
   able to locate the server. To be able to connect to the server, a bot
   has to query the domain name and resolve its IP address.

   If a group of hosts in a network have been compromised by the same
   botnet, an analysis method could be designed to detect similar
   queries from the same set of hosts within a timeperiod.

   A different approach would be to analyse the queries over time. A
   host querying the same domain on a regular interval could indicate a
   bot querying the server for new commands. This method would not work
   very well if the host has a local DNS cache that caches the query for
   a significant period of time.

   In some environments, e.g. server environments, hosts are left
   powered on outside office hours. If these hosts are infected with a
   botnet program the software would not stop querying the server
   outside office hours. This could easily be detected. As with the
   previous approach this will not work efficiently if a query is cached
   locally.

Approach?{J}. arXiv: Networking and Internet Architecture, 2010.]] paper

只是简单介绍了两种方式的区别，没有介绍两种方式的细节。

*** Introduction

A new category of netowrk security systems has appeared, specifically
geared to solve this problem. These systems utilize what is commonly
known as /Behavioral Anomaly Detecion/ or /Network Behavior Analysis/.
These systems intelligently take into account the behavior of the
network and the hosts taht are attached to that network.

*** Flow-Based Anomaly Detection

A flow record typically contains the IP network addresses of the two
hosts, network ports, network protocol, amount of data that was sent as
part of this connection, the time when the flow occurred as well as a
few miscellaneous flags.

Flow records are well suited to represent the interactions between hosts
in a network. By analyzing exported flow records and looking for unusual
amounts, directions, groupings and characteristics of flows, an anomaly
detection solution can infer the presence of worms or DDoS attacks in a
network.

*** Packet-Based Anomaly Detection

*** Flow-Based VS. Packet-Based

1. Network Scale:
   Packet-Based方式适用于中小企业的场景，Flow-Based适用于大数据量的场景，比如ISP等厂商；
2. Deployment Cost
3. Data Source:
   Packet信息相对更加详细，Flow信息则更加的泛化、总结性质。Packet-based
   solutions tend to build fine-grained, high-volume packet traces.
   这样通常比较耗时，解决方式可以有random data sampling, adaptive data
   sampling or partial data storing. low-level data only contain
   aggregated information which are coarse-grained and low-volume data.
4. Low-latency Anomaly Detection: Routers and switches usually export a
   flow after there has been a certain time of inactivity, typically 5
   to 15 seconds.
5. Anomaly Source Trace
6. Miscellaneous

M, Naser Mahmood A, Hu J. A survey of network anomaly detection
techniques{J}. Journal of Network & Computer Applications, 2016,
60:19-31.]] paper

领域的挑战：

-  A lack of universally applicable anomaly detection technique; for
   example, an intrusion detection technique in a wired network may be
   of little use in a wireless network.
-  Data contains noise which tends to be an actual anomaly and,
   therefore, is difficult to segregate.
-  A lack of publicly available labeled dataset to be used for network
   anomaly detection.
-  As normal behaviors are continually evolving and may not be normal
   forever, current intrusion detection techniques may not be useful in
   the future. A need for newer and more sophisticated techniques
   because the intruders are already aware of the prevailing techniques.

An anomaly can be categorized in the following ways:

-  Point anomaly: When a particular data instance deviates from the
   normal pattern of the dataset, it can be considered a point anomaly.
   For a realistic example, if a persons' normal car fuel usage is five
   litres per day but if it becomes fi fty litres in any randomday, then
   it is a point anomaly.
-  Contextual anomaly: When a data instance behaves anomalously in a
   particular context, it is termed a contextual or conditional anomaly;
   for example, expenditure on a credit card during a festive period,
   e.g., Christmas or New Year, is usually higher than during the rest
   of the year. Although it can be high, it may not be anomalous as high
   expenses are contextually normal in nature. On the other hand, an
   equally high expenditure during a non-festive month could be deemed a
   contextual anomaly.
-  Collective anomaly: When a collection of similar data instances
   behave anomalously with respect to the entire dataset, the group of
   data instances is termed a collective anomaly. For example, in a
   humans Electro Cardiogram (ECG) output, the existence of low values
   for a long period of time indicates an outlying phenomenon
   corresponding to an abnormal premature contraction whereas one low
   value by itself is not considered anomalous.

Type of networks attacks:

-  DoS: is a type of misuse of the rights to the resources of a network
   or host.
-  Probe: is used to gather information about a targeted network or host
   and, more formally, for reconnaissance purposes. It is the first step
   in an actual attack.
-  User to Root (U2R)
-  Remote to User (R2U)

*** 使用分类来进行检测

对于分类进行异常检测的评价：

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The classification based approaches rely on the normal trafficactivity
  profile that builds the knowledge base and consider activities deviate
  from baseline profile as anomalous. The advantage lies in their
  capability to detect attacks which are completely novel, assuming that
  they exhibit ample deviations from the normal profile. Additionally,
  as normal traffic not included in the knowledge base is considered an
  attack, there will be inadvertent false alarms. Therefore, training is
  required for anomaly detection techniques to build a normal activity
  profile which is time-consuming and also depends on the availability
  of completely normal traffic datasets. In practice, it is very rare
  and expensive to obtain attack-free traffic instances. Moreover, in
  today's dynamic and evolving network environments, it is extremely
  difficult to keep a normal profile up-to-date.
#+END_QUOTE

*** 使用统计理论来检测

统计方式进行异常检测：

1. Mixture Model:
   每个样本都是正常样本和异常样本的加权组合，最终反映为求两者分布的问题；
2. Signal processing technique
3. Principal component analysis(PCA), An anomaly detection technique
   based on PCA has the benefits of:

   -  being free from any assumption of statistical distribution;
   -  being able to reduce the dimension of the data without losing any
      important information; and
   -  having minimal computational complexity which supports realtime
      anomaly detection.

*** Information theory

Information-theoretic measures can be used to create an appropriate
anomaly detection model. In a paper by Lee and Xiang (2001), several
measures, such as *entropy*, *conditional entropy*, *relative entropy*,
*information gain* and *information cost*, are used to explain the
characteristics of a dataset.

*** Clustering-based

Although there are different types of clustering techniques, we discuss
the usefulness of regular *clustering* and *co-clustering* for network
anomaly detection. The difference between regular clustering and
co-clustering is the processing of rows and columns. Regular clustering
techniques such as k-means clusters the data considering the rows of the
dataset whereas the co-clustering considers both rows and columns of the
dataset simultaneously to produce clusters.

The three key assumptions that are always made when using clustering to
detect anomalies are briefly discussed below:

-  Assumption 1: As we can create clusters of only normal data, any
   subsequent new data that do not fit well with existing clusters of
   normal data are considered anomalies; for example, as density-based
   clustering algorithms do not include noise inside clusters, noise is
   considered anomalous.
-  Assumption 2: When a cluster contains both normal and anomalous data,
   it has been found that the normal data lie close to the nearest
   clusters centroid but anomalies are far away from centroids. Under
   this assumption,anomalous events are detected using a distance score.
-  Assumption 3: In a clustering with clusters of various sizes, the
   *smaller and sparser* can be considered anomalous and the thicker
   normal. Instances belonging to clusters the sizes and/or densities
   below a threshold are considered anomalous.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!-- end list -->
#+END_HTML

1. Regular clustering

   The approach used by Münz et al. (2007) to anomalous data is quite
   straightforward. They use k-means clustering to generate normal and
   anomalous clusters. Once clustering is achieved, it is analyzed using
   the following assumptions:

   -  An instance is classified as normal, if it is closer to the normal
      than anomalous clusters centroid and vice versa;
   -  If the distance between an instance and centroid is larger than a
      predefined threshold (d\_{max}), the instance is treated as an
      anomaly; and
   -  An instance is treated as an anomaly, if it is closer to the
      anomalous than normal clusters centroid or if its distance to the
      normal clusters centroid is larger than the predefined threshold.

2. Co-clustering

   Co-clustering can be simply considered a simultaneous clustering of
   both rows and columns (Govaert and Nadif, 2008; Banerjee et al.,
   2007). It can produce a set of ccolumn clusters of the original
   columns ((C)) and a set of (r) row clusters of the original row
   instances ((R)). Unlike other clustering algorithms, co-clustering
   defines a clustering criterion and then optimizes it. In a nutshell,
   it simultaneously finds the subsets of rows and columns of a data
   matrix using a specified criterion. The benefits of co-clustering
   over the regular clustering are the following:

   1. Simultaneous grouping of both rows and columns can provide a more
      compressed representation and it preserves information contained
      in the original data.
   2. Co-clustering can be considered as a dimensionality reduction
      technique and it is suitable for creating new features.
   3. Significant reduction in computational complexity. For example,
      traditional k-means algorithm has the (O(mnk)) as computational
      complexity where (m)=number of rows, (n)=number of columns and (k)
      is the number of clusters. But in co-clustering the computational
      complexity is (O(mkl+nkl)), here (l) is the number of column
      clusters. Obviously (O(mnk)>>O(mkl+nkl)).

对其提取的特征比较感兴趣，具体的算法内容没有看。

使用flow数据，抽取的特征为：

| Feature name            | Description                         |
|-------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| Packets/flow(P)         | Transferred packets in the flow.    |

| Duration(D)             | Duration of the flow (in seconds)   |
| Source port (SP)        | Source port of the flow             |
| Destination port (DP)   | Destination port of the flow        |
| TCP flags (TF)          | TCP flags in the flow               |

数据集是“用户名/时间戳/主机IP/用户IP/命令/命令参数”的六元组。在该数据集中挖掘关联规则和序列模式，分别使用了Apriori算法和滑动窗口分割算法来完成。

*** 模式挖掘

序列模式挖掘领域的常见算法有AprioriAll，AprioriSome，DynamicSome等。本课题使用的序列模式挖掘算法描述如下：

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  假设S是用户A的shell命令集(S={s\_1,...,s\_n})，其中(s\_i)代表用户执行的一条shell命令，指定滑动窗口的最大长度为MaxLen，最小支持度为MinSup。

  1. 设定初始滑动窗口宽度为len=1，在S中查找支持度大于MinSup的长度为1的序列，此时相当于查找出现概率大于MinSup的shell命令集；
  2. 递增滑动窗口宽度（len+=1），将窗口的左边界重合在(s\_1)处，得到从S中获取的长度为len的子序列(Sub\_1={s\_1,...,s\_{len}})，逐步向后移动窗口，每滑动一步，都得到一个长度为len的序列，滑动完成后，将会得到从S中获取的n-len+1个长度为n的子序列，对着n-len+1个子序列进行支持度计算，得到满足MinSup要求的长度为len的序列；
  3. 重复第2步，知道len=MaxLen
#+END_QUOTE

其实就是找ngram模式。

*** 模式比较

由于关联规则和序列模式在形式上都是序列，因此模式的比较工作编程序列的比较。模式比较算法使用了3种：

1. 全序列比较法：比较两个序列的相同部分和整个长度的占比；
2. 相关函数法
3. 递归相关函数

和 [[https://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2007/n18/4i.html][这里]]
说明了该数据集的不可靠性，主要是两点：

1. 数据集是模拟环境采集的，
2. 1999年的数据集中很多特征现在已经不再有效。

但是同时，又有2008年的论文（
